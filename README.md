# World_Weather_Analysis
# Project Overview
To practice  analysis, visualization, and statistical skills by retrieving and analyzing weather data for a hypothetical travel company, PlanMyTrip. The location chosen for part 3 of this project was Australia.

# Resources
Data Source: https://openweathermap.org/api 

Software: Jupyter Notebook, Pandas Library, CityPy, Python Request, APIs, JSON 

# Summary
In this projects, using API's we generated random Latitude and Longitude coordinate pairs across the world. We then found the closest city to each of those coordinate pairs. We then retrieved, collected, and cleaned weather data from each city coordinate pair. The weather data was then used to help prospective vacationers find a city and hotel that meet their weather preferences. We then added weather description to the weather data. Weather presences were added to identify ideal travel destinations and hotels nearby. Four cities were chosen to create a travel itinerary. Using Google Maps Directions API, a travel route was created between those four cities and a marker layer was added to the map.
